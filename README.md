PyBank is a script for analyzing financial records provided in budget_data.csv, which is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. 

The script calculates the total number of months in the dataset, the net Profit/Losses for the dataset, the changes in Profit/Losses and the average of those changes. It also determines the months with the greatest increase in profits and the greatest decrease in losses in the dataset. 

Finally, it prints its analysis to the terminal and then exports the information to a text file.

PyBank is a script for analyzing the voting records provided in election_data.csv, which is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. 

The script calculates the total number of votes cast in the election. It also lists each candidate who received votes, giving the candidates total vote count and percentage of votes won. The script then determines the winner of the election based on the popular vote.
